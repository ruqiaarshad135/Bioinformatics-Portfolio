# In-silico Analysis of SALL4 Gene

## Objective
This project demonstrates basic bioinformatics analysis of the SALL4 gene, including sequence retrieval, similarity search, and protein property analysis. The goal is to showcase hands-on skills in computational biology.

## Tools Used
- NCBI BLAST ([https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi))
- ExPASy ProtParam ([https://web.expasy.org/protparam/](https://web.expasy.org/protparam/))
- Clustal Omega (optional, [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/))

## Methodology
1. Retrieved the SALL4 gene/protein sequence from the NCBI database.
2. Performed BLAST analysis to identify homologous sequences in other species.
3. Analyzed protein physicochemical properties using ExPASy ProtParam, including molecular weight, isoelectric point (pI), and instability index.
4. (Optional) Conducted multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega to compare human SALL4 with mouse SALL4.

## Results
- BLAST results showed highest similarity with SALL4 in mouse, rat, and primates (identity ~95%-99%).
- Protein molecular weight: 65,708.46   
- Isoelectric point (pI): 8.71  
- Instability index: 56.66 (classified as unstable)

## Skills Gained
- Sequence retrieval from NCBI
- BLAST analysis and interpretation of results
- Protein property analysis using ExPASy ProtParam
- (Optional) Multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega
- Documenting bioinformatics workflows professionally

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to perform basic in-silico analysis of a gene/protein, use public bioinformatics tools, and document results in a professional manner suitable for a CV or portfolio.
