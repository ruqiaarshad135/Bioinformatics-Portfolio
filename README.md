Option 2: Create README.md on your computer
Open Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac)

Paste the same template text

Save the file as:

README.md
Make sure the extension is .md (not .txt)

When uploading to GitHub, just drag & drop this README.md along with your other files

💡 Tip: The README.md is mandatory for a good GitHub project. It tells anyone looking at your repository: “This is what I did, and here’s why it matters.”

If you want, I can make a ready-to-use README.md file for your SALL4 project that you can just copy/paste or upload directly — then your GitHub portfolio will be fully ready.

Do you want me to do that?

Perfect! 🌟 I’ve made a ready-to-use README.md for your SALL4 bioinformatics project. You can copy this exactly and upload it to GitHub — no writing needed.

# In-silico Analysis of SALL4 Gene

## Objective
This project demonstrates basic bioinformatics analysis of the SALL4 gene, including sequence retrieval, similarity search, and protein property analysis. The goal is to showcase hands-on skills in computational biology.

## Tools Used
- NCBI BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi)
- ExPASy ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/)
- Clustal Omega (optional, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)

## Methodology
1. Retrieved the SALL4 gene/protein sequence from the NCBI database.
2. Performed BLAST analysis to identify homologous sequences in other species.
3. Analyzed protein physicochemical properties using ExPASy ProtParam, including molecular weight, isoelectric point (pI), and stability index.
4. (Optional) Conducted multiple sequence alignment using Clustal Omega to compare human SALL4 with mouse SALL4.

## Results
- BLAST results showed significant similarity of SALL4 across mammalian species.
- Protein molecular weight: ___ kDa  
- Isoelectric point (pI): ___  
- Stability index: ___

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to perform basic in-silico analysis of a gene/protein, use public bioinformatics tools, and document results professionally.
